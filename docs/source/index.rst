Welcome to pspy's documentation!
================================

pypy is a cosmology code for calculating CMB power spectra and covariance matrices.
See the python example notebooks for an introductory set of examples on how to use the package.

If you want to work on the code from `GitHub <https://github.com/thibautlouis/pspy>`_, you can also just install in place without copying anything using::

  pip install -e /path/to/pspy [--user]
