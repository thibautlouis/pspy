Installing the code
-------------------

.. code:: shell

    $ git clone https://github.com/thibautlouis/pspy.git /where/to/clone

Then you can install the ``pspy`` library and its dependencies *via*

.. code:: shell

    $ pip install -e /where/to/clone

The ``-e`` option allow the developer to make changes within the ``pspy`` directory without having
to reinstall at every changes. If you plan to just use the likelihood and do not develop it, you can
remove the ``-e`` option.
